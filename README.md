## Predicting Boston Housing Prices
This project evaluated the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

### Data
The dataset used in this project is included with the scikit-learn library ([`sklearn.datasets.load_boston`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#sklearn.datasets.load_boston)). You do not have to download it separately. You can find more information on this dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing) page.
